# Remote Desktop
## RDP
Windows exclusive, although clients exist for other OSes. 
## VNC
- uses the Remote Frame Buffer (RFB) protocol. 
-  often open source
## Security
**Don't leave port tcp/3389 open!!**
both RDP and VNC can be brute forced. best to keep the ports off when not in use. 
# VPN
encrypts data from being intercepted on insecure networks.
- A concentrator does the decryption and encryption, this is often integrated with the firewall. 
- VPNs can be on demand or always on. 
- use Multi-factor authentication. end points are the attack points
