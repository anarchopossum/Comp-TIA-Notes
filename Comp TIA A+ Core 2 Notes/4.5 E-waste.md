# Disposal Procedures
Read the `Material Safety Data Sheets` (MSDS)
this is a document that OSHA has made to provide information on hazardous chemicals and how to dispose of them. 
Outside of the US, this sheet is called `Safety Data Sheet (SDS)`
Usually this information is also found in products such as toners and batteries. 
## Handling Waste
Make sure that you know where to dispose of batteries, where to recycle toner carts, and never throw out items without clear instructions. 
## Room Control
Make sure that both the temperature, and the humidity are optimal, 50% Humidity is safe area.
## Battery Backups
there are several types of UPS (uninterruptible power supply)
- **standby** switches to the battery once main power dies out. 
- **Line interactive** similar to standby, except switches quicker due to both battery and main are on. 
- **On-line** takes power only from the battery and uses main power only for charging the battery
## Surge Protection
make sure that you have a good protector, ideally 600 joules of protection and enough amps for your use case. Also the lower the UL 1449 let-through rating the better (500,400,330).
