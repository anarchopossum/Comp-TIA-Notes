# Wireless Encryption
## WPA2
created in 2004
the encryption mode is CCMP
it uses AES encryption and message integrity checks with CBC-MAC

this has a PSK brute-force problem, via 4 way handshake. Since the pre-shared key is the same when connecting to all devices, the key's hash can be captured and brute forced.
## WPA3
introduced in 2018
GCMP is stronger than WPA2
this is still using AES encryption and does message integrity checks (MIC) with GMAC
With WPA3 the authentication process is different from WPA2. WPA3 changes the PSK authentication process.
this removed the need for the 4 way handshake, and shared session keys going through the network.
SAE can derive keys from the device connecting and the network. everyone has a different session key even with the same PSK.
## Security Models
### WPA/2/3-(Personal/PSK)
these use pre-shared keys, everyone uses the same key.
### WPA/2/3-(Enterprise/802.1X)
Authenticates users individually with an authentication server (RADIUS)
# Authentication Methods
![[Pasted image 20240813202905.png]]
When we want to login, there is usually a server that acts as a login access point. this access point communicates with the login server to verify the login credentials. If valid, the access point will grant access to the internal servers.
## RADIUS
Remote authentication Dial-in User Service
This is one of the most common AAA protocols.
- Supports a large amount of platforms and devices
RADIUS gives centralized authentication for users to various network devices and services
## TACACS
Ciscos open standard for remote authentication. this was created to control over ARPANET via dial-up.
TACACS+ is the latest version of this protocol and gives more authentication requests and response codes.
- released in 1993
## Kerberos
is a network authentication protocol developed in MIT that just needs to authenticate once by the system and there is no need to re-authenticate. there is mutual authentication between client and the server. this way there is protections against on-path and replay attacks.
This has been a standard since 1980s. This is generally found in Windows Systems, specifically on windows 2000. Kerberos 5.0 Open standard was used for this implementation.
## SSO With Kerberos

Note this only works with Kerberos, there are other devices and services that are not Kerberos friendly. therefore there are other SSO methods like smart cards, SAML and more.
## Which to use?
That depends on what you already have configured. do you have a lot of CISCO devices use TACACS+, Already set up RADIUS? Use it. Windows and Kerberos setup already. use it!
## MultiFactor

This can be expensive or inexpensive depending on how you set it up.
