A good thing to note is that the numbering system is based on binary. such that the user is `111`, group is `100`, and Others is `100`.
You can also use letter configurations instead of numbers
`chmod a-w file` removes write permissions to all users.
`chmod a+w file` adds write permissions to file.
you can also string this as such `chmod g+wrx file` this gives read, write, and execute permissions to the group. or even `chmod a-r+wx` to give execution and write permissions, but read permissions disabled.
