# Social Engineering
- May use multiple methods of communication and people
- constantly changing
- Some pose as aggresive customers
- some pose as funeral notifications for associates or friends
the goal is to earn trust of people in the organization to gain access to restricted areas.
## Phishing
Fake website, texts, (e)mail, and more
Don't be fooled check the URLS, spelling, fonts and graphics
- spoofing of Caller ID is common as well
- Fake Security checks too
## Shoulder Surfing
someone that looks at your screen
common in airports, hallway facing monitors, Coffee shops
sometimes people use binoculars or telescopes
### prevent this
- control your enviroment
- use filters
- keep monitor away from sight
## Spear Phishing
this is targeted phishing with insider organization
- if it's the CEO it's called whaling
## Tailgating
someone who goes through a door without authorized access by holding the door. piggybacking is with someone with authorization.
### how to prevent
- One Scan per person
- Access control vestibule
- don't forget to ask for a badge.
## Impersonation
They pretend to be someone who they aren't
## Dumpter Diving
remember to shred important stuff or burn it!
## Wireless evil twin
WAP that has the same configuration as a legit one
they might have similar SSID and security settings/web portal. Sometimes it can even overwhelm the legit one.
remember to use https and proxys as well.
# Denial of Service
Force a service to fail
- turning off service
- hack service and damage it
- DNS spoofing
## accidental DOS
- 2 loop without STP in the patch closet
- Limited bandwidth
- Waterline broke or something
## DDOS
they use botnets to control thousands to millions of computers. Zeus infected over 3.6 million PCs.
### How to filter it
Filter traffic patterns
many ISPs look for DDOS attacks
use cloudflare
# Zero Day Attacks
Someone always is trying to find vulnerabilities before the companies find it.
some look for it to exploit, some look for exploits to gain profit.
Here is a database: [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org)
## Log4j
this is a logging based utility in apache services and installed on millions of servers. this vulnerability was introduced in September 14th, 2013 and was detected on December 9th, 2021
the CVS for this was a 10/10
after it was discovered, it was patched in 5 days and there were additional fixes for new patches to be found.
# On Path Attacks
also known as a Man in the middle attack
they watch the packets and even redirect them. and do ARP poisoning. where they spoof ip addresses.
### how it's done. 
usually the computer asks for who is the router. so it looks for 192.168.1.1. when the router gets the ping, the router will return it's MAC address.
on an attack the computer, this computer will spoof the router by copying and sending the routers IP and but with it's own MAC address and claiming they are in-fact the router.
ARP will then switch the routers actual mac address and to the attacks computer in confusion.
## Browser attack
if someone attacks your browser. the browser can see everything decrypted in the browser and will see your inputs as well.
# Password Attacks
## Plaintext Passwords
Very rare but this is the stupidest method of storing passwords. always hash passwords.
## Password Hashing
Hashes represent data as a fixed length string. All passwords regardless of actual character size. will have the same amount of characters when hashed. 
For example look at these passwords and their hash values:
![[Pasted image 20240822222408.png]]
- Hashes should not have any collisions meaning two hashes should not be the same.
- Impossible to recover original message once the password is hashed.
There are different hashing Algorithms. on linux you can see the password file showing a list of users, number and password hash
## Brute force
you have to try every hash and cross reference it. the better the algo, the longer it will take
Usually hackers download the hash and try to attack it offline.
## Dictionary Attacks
using a dictionary to find common words
the hopes is to find common words and letter substitutes.
# Insider Threats
Institutional Knowledge is key to these attacks. the more knowledge a worker knows, the more damage they can cause. sometimes the attack and knowledge intake takes a while.
## Recruiting Insiders 
sometimes people are hired to allow access or granted information of the corporation.
to protect yourself, maintain good security and backups
# SQL Injection
Code Injection, usually causes by bad programming.
this can be via
- html
- sql
- xml
- ldap
and more
If you don't sanitize your SQL inputs, then someone can run commands through SQL inputs that can cause large amount of damage.
Use [Web Goat](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/) as a security tool to learn more
# Cross-site scripting (XSS)
takes vulnerabilities from Javascript.
## Non-persistent
usually these are on user input like a search box. Attackers sometimes email links that take advantage of a vulnerability in JS to send credentials and other data to the attacker.
Script embedded in URL executes in the victim's browser
usually an attacker goes for your session ID as to impersonate a target and to collect any information within that session.
## Persistant (stored)
You can make a post on social media or similar sites with a payload. So anyone that visits that post or is shown that post they get infected.
### Subaru Hack
in 2017 someone hacked their Subaru to get the Token from their car. these tokens don't expire which is really bad and were not validated, therefore you can use other peoples cars as well through this.
## How to protect
don't click on link untrusted links, you can also try disabling JS, Validate input on databases, keep everything updated.
# Security Vulnerabilities
## Standard Operating Environment (SOE)
- tested and approved hardware/software
- often a standard operating system image
- these usually will need a lot of updates depending on how old it is.
 ## Patch Tuesday
 on 10am pst on the second Tuesday of the month MS releases patches for system vulnerabilities. this is usually a busy day for the IT department. usually the IT team has to make sure that everything works as intended and that all machines are properly patched and updated.
 remember to reenable antivirus and firewalls after testing/debugging
 ## Check for EOL/EOSL on OS and software.
 companies sometimes cancels support. you need this to make steps for the future.
 ## BYOD
 don't do this.
