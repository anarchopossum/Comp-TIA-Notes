# Differential backup
A full backup is first created. then any changes are subsequently backed up. usually these grow in size as the data is changed. 
to restore from this type of backup you will need the last full backup and the latest differential backup. ![[Pasted image 20240913165805.png]]
the differential grows in size as an accumulation.
# Incremental

A full backup is first created. then any changes from the full backup and the last incremental backup are backed up. 
A full restoration requires the full backup and all incremental backup.
