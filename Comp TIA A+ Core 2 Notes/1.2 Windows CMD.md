## Formatting

``` bash
format c:
```
### Diskpart
manage disks on the system. you will need administration to use it.
use `list` to see partitions and disks. type `help` for commands
## Copy
there are various methods of the `copy` command.
- `copy`
	- use `/v` to verify that the file were written correctly
	- use `/y` to skip verification
	- `copy /v dogs.png e:\photos`
- `xcopy`
	- Copies files/ folders recursively [xcopy - Microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/xcopy)
		- `/s` copies all files and folders except empty dir
		- `/e` Copies all subdirectories, even if they're empty
	- `xcopy /s Documents d:/SecretGovFiles`
- `robocopy`
	- [Robust copy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy) if a better version of xcopy in windows 10 and up.
	- robo copy is better for **network** drives. if connection is lost, it will resume when connection is reestablished.
	- can be set for certain time to work
	- Robo copy has more attributes it can copy
	- Robo copy can mirror copy
## Shutdown
`shutdown` turns off the PC, use 
- `shutdown /s /t nn` to set shutdown timer to `nn` seconds
- `shutdown /r /t nn` to set restart system timer to `nn` seconds
- `shutdown /a` to abort shutdown 
## Winver
shows your windows version
## gpupdate
to see what is the current policies use:
`gpresult /r`
to add someone to a group use:
`gpupdate /target:{computer_name|user_name} / force`
or for the same system:
`gpupdate /target:user_name / force`

# Windows Networking Commands
## ipconfig
shows adapter information for ipv4 and ipv6 and other info such as Hostnames, DNS servers, DHCP server, etc.
## ping
sends pings to a website via (ICMP) to check round trip time
## Netstat
network statistics, works on many operating systems
- `-a` show all active connections
- `-b` show binaries (windows)
- `-n` Do not resolve names
## nslookup
lookup IP/DNS names using nslookup
## net
this tool is used to send, share, and view information to a windows device.
### Examples:
these will show what shares might be available on a remote server
`net view \\<servername>` this will show all it's drives/partitions
`net view /workgroup:<servername>`
view user account information and reset passwords
`net user <username>`
`net user <username> * /domain`
Map a network share to a drive letter
`net use drive: \\<servername>\<sharename>`
`net use w: \\mediaServer\Photos`
## Tracert
Determine the route a packet takes to it's final destination
traceroute/tracert uses ICMP Time To Live Exceeded error message
- ttl=1 is first router, ttl=2 is second route
- How traceroute works is that there is a ttl value, this value increments every time the value hits zero. at first the value is `1` when the command is executed on a client machine. from here the next router will grab that packet will subtract `1` from the ttl. this leaves it as `0`. and because it's `0` it will send an error back to the client machine with all the hop information along with it.

- when this happens, the client will send a ttl with `2` and will go through the same steps, decreasing by 1. then hopping into the next server that will decrease it again. in this case the ttl value is now 0 and the error message is sent back.

this will keep going until the command goes to the designated location. once it finds the location. the last computer/server will send a ICMP reply.
## Pathping
it's a combination of traceroute and ping.
builds a map frist, then measures the round trip time and packet loss at each hop
