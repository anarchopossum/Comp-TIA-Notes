# What is an LCD?
- Liquid Crystal Display
- Light shines through liquid crystals
### Pros and Cons 
#### Pros
- Light weight
- somewhat low power
- Relatively inexpensive
#### Cons
- Black Levels Suck
- Requires a Back Light that are difficult to replace
## Types of LCDs
### TN (Twisted Dynamic)
- Oldest Tech
- ✅ Fast Responce
- ❌ Poor viewing angles
### IPS (In Plane Switching)
- ✅ Excelent Color Representation
- ❌ More expensive than TN
### VA (Vertical Alignment)
- Compromise Between TN and IPS
- ✅ Good Color Representation
- ❌ Slower response than TN
# OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode)
- Thinner and lighter - No Glass needed
- No Backlight
- organic compound (lights up when current passes through it)
- very accurate color representation
- Brighter than LCD Technology
- ❌ pricier than LCDs
# Display Peripherals 
## Antennas 
When replacing a screen, make sure that you take note of where the antenna wire are routed
## Webcam
Built in Webcams, Microphones and speakers are great for convenience although external versions of these are generally better.
## Backlightning
### Fluorescent vs LED Backlighting
#### CCFL Cold Cathode fluorescent lamp
- Higher Voltage needed
- Added thickness
- Not common anymore
#### LED Backlight
- Made up of LEDs
- can be on the edges or in a matrix
- Common on current Laptops
### Inverters 
- LCDs need backlighting for the user to view the contents. 
- DC ➡️ AC Power
- If you can't see the screen well due to dimness, you might need to replace the inverter
#### Digitizer
- Comes on many Tablets and hybrids
- Analogue ➡️ Digital signal
