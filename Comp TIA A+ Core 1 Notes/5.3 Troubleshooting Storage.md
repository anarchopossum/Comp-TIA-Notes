# Storage failure symptoms
Read/Write failure
- cannot read from source disk
Slow Performance
- constant LED activity due to retrying
Loud clicking noise
- is failing or has already failed
# Troubleshooting
- make sure to backup
- check for overheating
- check the psu to make sure you aren't overloading
- Check for damaged/loose cables
- run drive diagnostics
# Boot Failure symptoms
Drive not recognized
- No lights
- beeps
- error messages
OS not found
- drive not installed
- No OS on drive
# troubleshooting Boot Failures
- Check cables
- Check boot sequence in BIOS
	- removable disks
	- disabled storage devices
- for new installation, check Hardware config
	- DATA/Power cables
	- try different SATA interfaces
- try drive in another system
# Data loss/ corruption
HDD are usually going to fail eventually
these are expensive to repair and not always sucessful
SSDs can also stop working
- sometimes can read but not write
Data can become unrecoverable
# RAID not found
Missing or faulty RAID controller?
- Each RAID configuration is different. check the console before pulling drives out.

# S.M.A.R.T
self monitoring analysis and reporting technology
you can use 3rd party utilities to check on drives
look at warning signs for hardware failure
schedule disk checks.
best to replace a drive before it's too late
# Extended Read/Write times
When it comes to seeing our I/O times we can use IOPS Input Output Per Second
- it's a broad metric of maximum performance
	- HDD 200 IOPS
	- SSD 1,000,000 IOPS
# Missing Drive in OS
sometimes we have to check the BIOS, connections and network configuration for network shares
