# #Satellite networking
- Non-Terrestrial communication
- High Cost compared to terrestrial networking
	- 50Mb/s Down, 3 Mb/s Up is common
	- For Remote sites
- High Latency
	- 250 ms up/down Ping
	- Starlink 40ms currently, working on 20ms
- Hig Frequency
	- 2GHz
	- Line of Sight, rain fade
# #Fiber
- Equipment is costly and difficult to repair
- SONET, wavelength division multiplexing
# #Broadband
Transmission across multiple frequencies
- TV
- Phone
- Internet
This standard is called #DOCSIS - Data Over Cable Service InterfaceSpecification
Speeds of 50Mb/s to 1Gb/s are common
# #DSL
These use telephone lines to gain internet access
Considered Asymmetric due to Download being faster than Upload
- 200Mb/s Down
- 20Mb/s Up
#ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
must be 10,000 ft from the Central Office to receive internet
# Cellular Networks
Tethering is a form of internet for computers
- Hotspot
- USB
# #WISP
Terrestrial internet access using wireless

Using different tech such as
- Mesh 802.11
- 5G home internet
- Proprietary wireless
Needs an antenna
- 10-1000 Mb/s a second

# LAN
Local Area Network
usually found in a building or a group of building
ethernet or 802.11
# WAN
If it's somewhere from another part of the world it's WAN
- Much slower than LAN networks.
Many Different WAN Tech, Look above in notes
# PAN
Personal Area Network
- Bluetooth
- IR
- NFC
# MAN
Metropolitan Area Network
- City Network
- Larger than LAN smaller thanWAN
Historically Metro Ethernet
# SAN
Storage Area Network
- Looks and feels like a local storage device
- Block level access
- Very Efficient reading and writing
Requires High Bandwidth
# WLAN
802.11
Mobility within a building
if needed more area you need more Access points
