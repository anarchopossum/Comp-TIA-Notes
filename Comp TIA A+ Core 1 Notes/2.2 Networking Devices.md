Understand what these devices are and what they are used for.
# Router
Routers traffic between IP #Subnets
- Makes forwarding decisions based on IP address
- Routers inside of switches sometimes called "layer 3 switches"
## Connects different network types
- Lan
- Wan
- Copper
- Fiber
# Switches
Forwards data based on MAC Address
- Done in hardware
- using ASIC devices (application specific integrated circuit)
- Forwards based on datalink address
- Can give POE depending on the model
- turn on additional routing functions are a layer 3 or multifunction switch
# Unmanaged Switch
- little configuration options
- No VLAN
- Very little integration with other devices
- simple and cheap
No management Protocols
- No #SNMP Capabilities 
# Managed Switch
- VLAN support
	- Connects with other switches via 802.1Q
- Traffic prioritization
	- Give VOIP more priority over File Transfer
- Redundancy support
	- Spanning Tree Protocol #STP
	- this helps to stop looping in switches
- Port Mirroring
	-  copy traffic to another port on the witch, used to diagnose issues
- External Management from #SNMP
# Access point
- Not a Wireless router
	- **Bridges** wireless to wired connections. but does not route traffic
- Makes forwarding decisions based on MAC address
- Similar to a switch but works with WIFI antennas
# Patch Panels
these panels are used as an intermediate connection to a switch.
Instead of having to manage and reroute long cables across the office. we would just need to manage the cable in between the patch panel and the switch.
- Combination of Punch-down blocks and RJ-45 connectors
- Runs from desks are made once, no need to reroute large cables.
# Firewalls
Filters traffic by port number
- OSI layer4 (TCP/UDP)
- Some firewalls can filter based on applications
	- In that case it's layer 7
- Can encrypt traffic into/out of the network from site to site
- Can Proxy traffic
	1. client requests data
	2. firewall receives it and sends it as their own request
	3. firewall receives requested content and scans it for malicious content
	4. firewall sends it to client
- Can act as a router
	- Usually sits as an ingress/egress of the network
# Power over Ethernet (PoE)
Provide power on the Ethernet cable
- One wire for internet and power
- Phones, cameras, WAP
- difficult areas to power
Power is provided at the switch
- built in power on switch = Endspans
- In-line power injector = Midspans
Switches will label which ports can use #PoE usually with a different color.
## Types of #PoE
### PoE: IEEE 802.3af-2003
- Original PoE specification
- Part of the 802.3 standard
- 15.4 watts DC power, 350 mA Max current
### PoE+: IEEE 802.3at-2009
- Also part of the 802.3 standard
- 25.5 watts DC power, 600 mA max current
### PoE++: IEEE 802.3BT-2018
- 51 W (type 3) 600 mA max current
- 71.3 W (type 4) 960 mA max current
- Poe with 10GBASE-T (10 Gigabyte)
# Hub
Also known as a multi-port repeater
- Traffic going in one port goes to all output ports
- Everything is #half-duplex
	- One computer can only communicate through a wire at a time
- Becomes less efficient as the traffic increases
- 10 megabit / 100 megabit
- hard to find (second and only)
# Cable modem
## Broadband
- Transmits across multiple frequencies
- Different traffic types
- Video / phone / internet data can be given through
- Data on the "cable" network
	- DOCSIS (data Over cable service interface specification)
	- High-speed networking
		- up to 1Gb/s are available
## DSL modem
- ADSL (Asymmetric Digital subscriber Line)
	- Uses telephone lines
	- Asymmetric because download is faster than upload
		- 10,000 ft limitation from central office (CO)
		- 52 Mb/s down 16 Mb/s Up
		- faster speeds if closer to CO
## ONT
Optical network terminal
- Connects to ISP fiber network and converts it to computer standards
- outside of the building usually
- Demarcation point (demark)
	- Usually in the datacenter or outside of your home
	- anything inside your home is your responsibility
	- anything on the outside is the ISP responsibility
# NIC
A fundamental networking device. every device on the network has a NIC
Specific network types are
- Ethernet
- WAN
- wireless
- etc.
often built into the motherboard
- single port
- multi port
- copper
- fiber
