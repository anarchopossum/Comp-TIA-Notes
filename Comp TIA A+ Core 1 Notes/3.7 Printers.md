### Imaging Drum
#Laser-Printers 
#### Steps of a Laser Printer
1. Image is rendered in Memory
2. Charge roller spins to reset the photosensitive drum with a negative charge
3. Image is drawn onto a (OPC) **Organic photoconductive drum**  with a positive charge (exposing phase)
4. Picks up toner based on the positive electric charge on drum
5. transfers to the paper
6. heat and pressure fuses the toner.
7. Cleaning phase removes any excess toner on the drum
When needing replacement it **can be separate or combined with your toner cartridge.**
Usually easy to access and clean
### Fuser Assembly
Uses Heat and pressure to melt the plastic toner powder to permanently bond it to the paper
### Transfer Belt and Roller
[How a transfer belt works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F7kG9rSGEg)
Color Laser printers will go through the standard procedure of 
1. drawing onto the drum
2. picking up the toner based on electric charge.
3. Places it onto the transfer belt
4. Fuses the ink to the paper
### Pickup Rollers
picking up a single sheet is it's job, if the roller is picking up none or too many. there might be an issue
### Separation Pad
Works with the pick up rollers to pick up one sheet, It's a cheap part and common to replace
### Duplex Printing
Printing on both sides by printing on one side, flips the paper and prints on the back.
- can be built in or add-on

## Laser Maintenance
### Replacing Toner Cartridge
- Look for low toner message
	- Sometimes the OPC and the toner come together, *Keep it in a bag, it's sensitive to light.*
- Power down the printer, then replace the cartridge. make sure all the packaging is removed.
### Laser printers maintenance kit
manufactures will sometimes sell kits for printer maintenance.
- Feed rollers
- fuser units
- etc.
Usually the manufacture tells you to do maintenance at a certain page count
remember to power down and let it cool down. especially the fuser. Remember to reset the page counter too.
### Laser Printer Calibration
Different toner cartridges print at different densities. calibration via automatic or manual is important to do.
### Cleaning
Laser printers leave a lot of paper and toner dust.
Use a rag and water or Isopropyl alcohol to clean toner from the inside (check manufacturer's recommendations). wash toner with cold water.
clean rollers with IPA. don't use a vacuum unless it's made for laser printer cleaning.
- Use cold water to clean it off of your skin. never hot or warm.
# #InkJet
### Pros
- cheap machines
- quiet
- HD
### Cons
- expensive and proprietary
- Eventually fades rapidly
- clogs easily
### Print Heads
some consumer printers integrate the print head into the ink cartridge from the print head
### Feed Rollers
Picks up paper through the printer, these will need to be cleaned and maintained
#### Duplexing supported
flips page to print the back
### Inkjet printer Calibration
Align nozzles to the paper
- lines should be crisp
- colors should align
## Maintenance
### Cleaning the print heads
- Small droplets of ink can clog the heads
	- If it has streaks or sections of missing color. it needs cleaning
	- usually the printer does the cleaning on it's own, but might need manual intervention
	- Easy to clean take the cartridge out and do so
### Replacing inkjet cartridges
- Easy to replace the CMYK cartridges, they pop out and you can throw in a new one
### Calibration
- align nozzles to the paper
- printer includes a calibration option
### Clearing Jams (InkJet)
remove the paper in the tray and firmly remove the paper, you might be able to release tension in the settings. try to not rip the paper.
# #Thermal-Printer
thermal printers do not use ink, just heat. the heated parts turn black.
- Very Quiet
- Paper is sensitive to heat, light and tape
### Feed Assembly
Pull paper through the printer.
### Heating Element
Full length heating element, **no moving print head**
### Thermal paper
Thermochromic paper. this paper is covered with a chemical that turns black with heat.
## Maintenance 
### Thermal paper replacement
depending on the printer, you need specific papers.
### Cleaning the heating element
Remember to clean the heating element with IPA and use a cleaning pen if possible, check the manufacture's recommendations.
- Swab gently
- use cleaning cards if possible
### Removing Debris
you can use compressed air or a damp cloth to clean out paper bits and dust in the printer
- don't use a vacuum unless it's made for electronics.
### paper and heat
hot areas will make the paper completely black.
Also the print will fade overtime regardless.
# #Impact-Printer
- print head uses a small matrix of pins (dots) to print out information. 
- the head will hit pins against a ribbon to make a mark
- good for carbon/multiple copies
- Low cost per page
- Noisy
- poor resolution
### Print head
moves back and forth using the print heads to punch in the ink via ribbon
- sometimes is 24 pins and the size of the pins in total is one character
### Ribbon
- it's a very long Fabric that loops around.
- Easy to replace as one single unit
- Ribbons are proprietary in size
### Tractor feed
uses holes on the sides to move the paper.
- has perforations to remove the feed holes
- perforations on tops to separate the pages
## Maintenance
### Ink Ribbons
easy to replace, when the pages get lighter and lighter, it's time to replace.
designed to be easily replaceable in less than a minute.
### Impact Head Replacement
- Takes a lot of abuse and will need replacement.
- be careful its hot
- easy to remove with a release lever or bar.
- it's a good idea to replace the ribbon too, to get a perfect new start.
### Replacing paper
- No paper trays.
- make sure it's straight and lined up perfectly
- make sure there is nothing in the way
