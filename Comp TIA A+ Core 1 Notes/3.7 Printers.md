### Imaging Drum
#Laser-Printers 
#### Steps of a Laser Printer
1. Image is rendered in Memory
2. Charge roller spins to reset the photosensitive drum with a negative charge
3. Image is drawn onto a (OPC) **Organic photoconductive drum**  with a positive charge (exposing phase)
4. Picks up toner based on the positive electric charge on drum
5. transfers to the paper
6. heat and pressure fuses the toner.
7. Cleaning phase removes any excess toner on the drum
When needing replacement it **can be separate or combined with your toner cartridge.**
Usually easy to access and clean
### Fuser Assembly
Uses Heat and pressure to melt the plastic toner powder to permanently bond it to the paper
### Transfer Belt and Roller
[How a transfer belt works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F7kG9rSGEg)
Color Laser printers will go through the standard procedure of 
1. drawing onto the drum
2. picking up the toner based on electric charge.
3. Places it onto the transfer belt
4. Fuses the ink to the paper
### Pickup Rollers
picking up a single sheet is it's job, if the roller is picking up none or too many. there might be an issue
### Separation Pad
Works with the pick up rollers to pick up one sheet, It's a cheap part and common to replace
### Duplex Printing
Printing on both sides by printing on one side, flips the paper and prints on the back.
- can be built in or add-on

## Laser Maintenance
### Replacing Toner Cartridge
- Look for low toner message
	- Sometimes the OPC and the toner come together, *Keep it in a bag, it's sensitive to light.*
- Power down the printer, then replace the cartridge. make sure all the packaging is removed.
### Laser printers maintenance kit
manufactures will sometimes sell kits for printer maintenance.
- Feed rollers
- fuser units
- etc.
Usually the manufacture tells you to do maintenance at a certain page count
remember to power down and let it cool down. especially the fuser. Remember to reset the page counter too.
### Laser Printer Calibration
Different toner cartridges print at different densities. calibration via automatic or manual is important to do.
### Cleaning
Laser printers leave a lot of paper and toner dust.
Use a rag and water or Isopropyl alcohol to clean toner from the inside (check manufacturer's recommendations). wash toner with cold water.
clean rollers with IPA. don't use a vacuum unless it's made for laser printer cleaning.
- Use cold water to clean it off of your skin. never hot or warm.
