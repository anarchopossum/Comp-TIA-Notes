# Change Management
this is a process to manage a change, either software or whatever that might be. We have to make sure for:
- Plans for change
- downtime
- confusion
- mistakes & risks
- Recovery plans
- tests before making the change
- policies and procedures
- Documenting everything before approval
We should also make sure everyone knows about this change as well. So we have less issues.
# Troubleshooting process

## Gather information
- get as many details, try to replicate the issue if possible
## ID symptoms
- possibly various symptoms
## Question users
- best way to get details
## Determine if anything has changed?
see if anyone has changed something in the configuration
## multiple problems
approach them one at a time. too much and you won't get anything done.
# ID The Problem
## Backup everything
since you are making changes, it's best to ensure that there is a form of rollback just incase something goes wrong.
## Any Changes?
again try to see if any of the users made changes that they are not aware such as environment and infrastructure changes.
## Any Clues
- Check OS Log Files
- Applications might have logs too
# Establish a Theory
- Start with the obvious. simplest explanation is often the most likely.
- Although when it's not common or usual sometimes we have to consider outside of the box
- Make a list of possible causes, start with the easiest theories and the least difficult to test.
- Research Symptoms
	- check online
# Test the Theory
Confirm the Theory, if it does not solve the problem look through all your theories you listed.
- if you can't figure it out bring in an expert
If a theory works! we have to now make a plan of action
# Plan of action
We must create a plan to create the issue with minimal impact.
- refer to vendor instructions, support articles, documentation and more
Make sure you know the potential effects, have a plan B and C!
# Implement the solution
after being given a date to implement, we want to change it within the control window, if the window is too short. find a 3rd part for help
# Once the fix is implemented
you must now perform tests that should of been implemented as a part of your plan. Have your customer confirm the fix.
- Implement preventative measures
	- lets avoid the issue happens again
# Documentation
Document how you fixed the solution and what changes were implemented. usually this is done on help desk software.
