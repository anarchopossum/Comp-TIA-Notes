# 802.11a
- October 1999
- exclusively in the 5GHz range
	- Other Freq with special licensing
- 54Mb/s
- Smaller range than 802.11b
# 802.11b
- October 1999
- Operates at 2.4Ghz range
- 11Mb/s
- Less absorption problems than 802.11a
- More Frequency Conflicts
	- Baby Monitors
	- Cordless phones
	- microwaves
	- Bluetooth
# 802.11g
- June 2003
- 2.4Ghz range
- 54 Mb/s
- Backwards compatible with 802.11b
- Same Frequency conflicts as b
# 802.11n (wifi 4)
Became the new standard that updated all the older Wifi Standards
- October 2009
- Operates at 5Ghz and/or 2.4Ghz
	- 40MHz channel width (bandwidth) per antennas (4 max)
- MIMO (multi-in Multi-out)
	- Multiple transmit and receive antennas
# 802.11ac (wifi 5)
- Jan 2014
- Operates in the 5GHz band
	- If you see a router that says it takes 2.4GHz as well, it does 802.11n on 2.4GHz and ac on 5GHz
	- 160MHz channel bandwidth
- Increased channel bonding
- Denser signaling modulation
	- faster data transfer
- eight Mu-MIMO downlink stream
	- Twice as many streams as 802.11n
	- Nearly 7 gigabits per second
# 802.11ax (wifi 6)
- Feb 2021
- Operates at 5GHz and/or 2.4GHz
	- 20, 30, 40, 80, & 160 MHz channel widths
- 1201 Mb/s per channel
	- Same amount of Mu-MIMO downstream channels as ac
	- Adds upstream to those channels
- Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)
	- Works similar to cellular communication we have used for years
	- Improves high density installations such as at conventions and offices

# Long Range fixed wireless
- WAP in a house with stock antennas
	- range of 40 to 50 meters
- Try connecting two buildings located miles form each other
	- Fixed directional antennas and increased strength for speeds/reliability
- Outdoor antennas
	- Minimal signal absorption
- Direction antennas
	- Focused, pointed to point connections (such as an office)
- Wireless Regulations should be noticed
	- State, Local and Federal levels should be noted
- Frequency types
	- 2.4 and 5 GHz are unlicensed
	- Other frequencies are available with licensing
- Signal strength Regulations
	- Indoor and Outdoor
- Outdoor antenna installation is not trivial
	- Bring in an expert
# RFID
- Radar technology powers the chip when close by
# NFC
- Two way wireless communication
- Payment Systems
- Identification

# Wireless Tech Standards
## Frequency
- 2.4 and 5.0 Ghz
- Sometimes both
# Channels
- groups of frequencies, Numbered by the IEEE
- Non-overlapping channels would be ideal
## Regulations
- Most countries have regulations to manage frequency use
- Spectrum use, power output, interference requirements
## Band Selection
- 2.4GHz
	- 2412Mhz to 2482Mhz @ 20Mhz
![[Pasted image 20240419000503.png]]
## Bluetooth
- Uses the 2.4Ghz range
- Unlicensed ISM
	- Industrial, Scientific and Medical band
- same as 802.11
- Consumer range 10 meters
- Industrial 100 meters
