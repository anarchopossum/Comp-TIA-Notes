# #DNS Server
- Converts IP or Domains names
- Distributed naming system
	- Load balanced across many servers
- Usually managed by ISP or enterprise IT department
	- Critical resources
# #DHCP
- Automatically assigns IP addresses
- In most home routers
- enterprise might have multiple for redundancy 
# File Server
Centralized Storage of documents
- SMB for windows
- AFP for Macintosh
# Print Servers
connect a printer to the network
- might be a computer connected to the printer
- might be built in wifi/ethernet
Uses standards such as
- SMB (server message block)
- IPP (Internet Printing Protocol)
- LPD (line Printer Daemon)
# Mail Server
- Stores incoming mail
- Usually managed by ISP or enterprise IT department
- Usually 24/7 service it's very important
# Syslog
it's a log collector. it logs system information into a database
- Standard for message logging
- Integrated int SIEM
- Lots of disk space required
# Web Servers
Website servers

# Authentication Server
- Server to log into centralized management servers
- Almost always on enterprise
- Usually a set of redundant servers
	- Always Available 
# Spam
- Unsolicited messages
- Difficult to identify
- difficult to manage
## Spam Gateway
these are servers connected to the firewall that take in all email messages. The purpose is to filter spam away from works so they don't get phished, but still be able to hold it just incase for false positives, or for training.
Once the mail is filtered it will go into the internal network

# Proxy Server
- An intermediate server
	1. Client makes the request to the proxy
	2. The proxy performs the actual request
	3. The proxy provides results back to the client
- Features
	- Access control
	- Caching
	- URL filtering
	- content scanning
# SCADA / ICS
Supervisory control and data acquisition system is a large scale, multi-site industrial control system (ICS). These use sensor data logged by microcontrollers or IoT devices and sent to a server. then the server collects and analyses the data.
- PC manages equipment
	- power generators
	- refining
	- manufacturing equipment
- Distributed control systems
	- real time system control and information
- Requires extensive segmentation from the network
	- No access from the outside
# Legacy and Embedded systems
- Legacy systems
	- old systems on old hardware / software
- Embedded systems
	- purpose built
	- no direct access
	- alarm system, timecards, door security
# IoT
- Appliances
- Smart devices
- AC systems
- Access doors
- May require a segmented network
