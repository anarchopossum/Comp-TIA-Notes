# Cable Crimpers
Special tool to add a connector to a cable such as
- Coaxial
- twisted pair
- fiber
for twist pair these are pushing prongs through the insulation and into the copper wire itself

# Crimper
- get a good crimper
- electrician scissors/cable snips
- good wire stripper
Make sure you are using the right connector for the right cable
# WiFi analyzer
Wireless networks are incredibly easy to monitor
listens to all frequencies in the network
this tool can be
- hardware
- mobile device add on
This can be useful for interference and errors
# Tone Generator
Toner Probe
- useful to ID wires
Inductive Probe
- small speaker will let you know if there is a connection
# Punch down tool
Punch down a wire to a block
- 66 block
- 110 block
- etc.
Can be tedious
Organization is key
Maintain the twist all the way down to the block
# Cable tester
after crimping these are useful as a means to figure out what pins work and which don't after punch down
- no singnal loss or crosstalk info
# Loopback Plug

a ethernet plug that sends the information back. this is a method to see if all the connections work as well
- Ethernet
- T1
- Fiber
- not a crossover cable

# Taps and port mirrors
Intercept network traffic
- sends a copy to the capture device
Physical taps
- place the tap in between a connection
- this can be passive or active tap
	- Passive for Fiber
	- Active needs electricity for copper
Port Mirror
- SPAN (Switch port ANalyzer)
- - software-based tap
- Limited functionality, can work in a pinch
