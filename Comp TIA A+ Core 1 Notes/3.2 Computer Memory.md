# Memory Types
Data and programs can only be used when it's moved to RAM
## DIMM
Dual inline Memory module
these are in 64 bit data width
## SODIM
Small outline Dual in-line memory module
- made for laptops
## DRAM
Always needs refreshing of memory
- Any location in memory can be accessed directly

## SDRAM
Synchronous DRAM
- Queue up one process while waiting for another
- Classic DRAM did not wait for a clock signal
## SDR vs DDR
in one clock cycle we can transfer 2 data blocks at a time

## DDR3
Max 16GB per DIMM

## DDR4
- faster Frequency
- MAX 64GB per DIMM
## DDR5
- Max 64GB per DIMM
- Faster than DDR4

# Memory Tech
## Virtual Memory
AKA SWAP File
- Should be the size of your RAM + 1GB
## Multi-channel Memory
- Memory combinations should match
## Self Check Memory
- Usually in Servers
### Parity memory
- adds an additional parity bit
- Won't always detect an error
- Can't fix it

If there is a even amount the Parity bit is zero. if we need a bit to make it even, the parity bit will be 1. if it's even or made even it's valid.
### EEC Memory
Error Correcting Code
- Detects errors and corrects on the fly
- looks similar to non-ECC memory
