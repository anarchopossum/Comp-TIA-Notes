# #DNS Configuration
Human readable website names to IP addresses
- work on a hierarchy
Distributed
- 13 root clusters (thousands of servers)
- Hundreds of top level domains
	- .com .org. net
- 275 country specific
	- .us .ca. uk
# DNS Lookup
You can use the `dig` or the `nslookup` command to find the IP addresses

# DNS records
- Resource Records (RR)
	- The database records of domain name services
- over 30 types
	- IP, Certs, Host alias name, etc.
- Make sure to keep backups of your DNS servers
# DNS Configuration
- you can configure an DNS with a text file
- or also Web based front end too
# Address records (A) (AAAA)
This defines the IP address of a host
- ==A== records are for ==IPv4== addresses
- ==AAAA== records are for ==IPv6== Addresses
# Mail Exchange record (MX)
this is for mail services you will need an `A` Record for this as well
## Text records (TXT)
- Human readable text information
	- Useful for public information
- Can Now be used for verification
	- If you have access to the DNS, Then you must be the administrator of the domain
- Commonly used for Email Security
	- External email servers validate information from your DNS
- You can find text records with dig
	- `dig domainname.com txt`
	- `nslookup -type=txt domainname.com`
# Sender Policy Framework #SPF
This is a list of all servers authorized to send emails for this domain. This prevents mail spoofing, Mail servers preform a check to see if incoming mail really came from the authorized host
# Domain Keys Identified Mail #DKIM
Digitally sign a domain's outgoing mail
- Validated by mail servers, not seen usually by end user
- Public Key is in DKIM TXT record
# DMARC
Domain Based message authentication, reporting and conformance
- prevents spoofing
- An extension of #SPF and #DKIM
With DMARC you can say what to do with the mail that comes in that is not authenticated.
- Compliance reports
- accept mail, send to spam, reject mail

# #DHCP Configuration
## DHCP pools
Each subnet has it's own scope
- 192.168.1.0/24
- 192.168.2.0/24
- 192.168.3.0/24

A scope is a pool of IP addresses
- DHCP exceptions can be made inside of the scope
## Web configuration for DHCP

## Address assignment
- DHCP has a big pool of addresses to give out
addresses are reclaimed after a lease period
- If you leave the network and no other device takes that IP, the DHCP server will give you the same IP address it initially gave you
## Address allocation
no other device can take it. marked by MAC address
## Lease
IP addresses are given out for a limited time
- You can set the lease time in the DHCP server
Rebooting your computer confirms the lease 
- (as it boots it will have the same IP)
Clients can also release the IP address and move to another IP or subnet entirely
## Renewal
### T1 Timer
- checks in at half the lease time by default and renews the timer
### T2 Timer
- Checks at 87.5% of the lease time or 7/8ths of the time
- If it finds it, it will renew the time
### Example

# VLANS and VPNS
## LANS
A group of devices in the same broadcast domain

## VLANS
instead of having two switches per broadcast domain. We can have one switch with software separating the devices virtually. We can separate the devices using specific ethernet port ranges (0-9)|(10-19)
Note: VLANS are usually labeled by number 1, 2,3, etc.

# #VPNS
Encrypted data traveling in a public network
### Concentrator
Hardware that encrypts and Decrypts access devices
- Often integrated in a firewall
### Encryption
- Hardware encryption
- Software encryption
### Client to Site VPN
- Software can be on demand access or always on
