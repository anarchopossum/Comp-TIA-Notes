Internet Packets have a head and a tail, within that payload there might be IP, TCP/UDP information and the contents being sent
# TCP UDP
Both work in OSI layer 4
## #Multiplexing 
using different applications at the same time 
## TCP
- formal connections and closure
- recover from errors
- flow control to manage speed of download or upload
- HTTPS and SSH both use TCP
- application is not responsible to track information TCP does it
## UDP
- Connectionless flow
- Sends data and no acknowledgement 
 - DHCP and TFTP both use UDP
 Application is responsible to track information and use it
## IPV4
 Server IP -> protocol -> Server application port number
 Client IP -> protocol -> Client Port number
 ### Non-ephemeral (permanent) ports
 - permanent port numbers
 - Port range: **0 -> 1023**
 - usually on server or service
 ### Ephemeral ports
 - temporary ports
- Port range: **1024 -> 65535**
 Determined in real time by client
- TCP and UDP uses the whole range of ports from 0 to 65535
- even though it can go through the spectrum of ports some are reserved to be TCP and UDP
**Most services use permanent port numbers**
*Although it's not always the case sometimes it jumps depending on the application***

----
# Port Numbers
port numbers are important for firewalls
## FTP
- TPC on port 20 to active transfer
- TCP on port 21 for transfer control
## TelNet
- TCP on port 23
- unsafe use SSH
## #SMTP (simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- TCP | port 25
- Server to server transfer
- Usually used to send mail, POP3 and IMAP to receive mail
## DNS
Converts Domain names to IP addresses
- UDP | 53
## #DHCP
IP address assignment to Clients from DHCP Server
- UDP | 67 | CLIENT
- UDP | 68 | SERVER
DHCP uses two since ports when they are first establishing connection to a device that does not have an IP address.
- These ports work via Broadcast
DHCP Server requires
- Server, Appliance, integrated into a SOHO router
- IP addresses are assigned in real-time from a pool
- Each system is given a lease on an IP that needs to be renewed (to check if the IP address still is being used)
### Steps for DHCP
1. Client sends a `DHCPDISCOVER`
2. Server receives `DHCPDISCOVER` and sends a `DHCPOFFER`
3. Client accepts `DHCPOFFER` and sends a `DHCPREQUEST`
4. Server accepts `DHCPREQUEST` and sends a `DHCPACK` as a confirmation
Note this is not encrypted since the attack likelihood is not common in home applications, although can be enabled for offices and more using TLS
## POP3/IMAP
### POP3 Post office Protocol
- TCP / 110
- basic mail transfer. usually meant for just one device
### IMAP4 Internet Message Access Protocol
TCP 143
- Like Pop3 but synchronization between devices
## #SMB - Sever Message Block
- Microsoft protocol for file and print jobs
- Also Called CIFS (common internet file system)
### Using #NetBIOS over TCP/IP (old windows)
- UDP /137 NetBIOS name services (nbname)
- TCP/139 NetBIOS session service (nbsession)
### Direct over TCP/445 (NetBios-less)
- TCP/445
- Direct SMB communication over TCP and NetBIOS transport
# #SNMP
Simple Network Management Protocol
Used by system admins to test performance details as Queries.
Traps are used when a threshold is set
- Gather statistics from network devices
	- Queries: UDP/161
	- Traps: UDP/162
### V1
- structured tables
- in the clear (non-encrypted)
### V2
- Data type enhancements
- Bulk transfers
- Still unencrypted
### V3
- Message integrity
- Authentication
- Encryption
# #LDAP (lightweight directory access protocol)
- TCP | 389
- Store and retrieve information in a network directory
- commonly ==used in Microsoft Active Directory==
# RDP
Share a desktop form a remote location
- TCP/3389
- Many Windows version
- Can connect to an entire desktop or just an application
- Clients for various OS platforms
