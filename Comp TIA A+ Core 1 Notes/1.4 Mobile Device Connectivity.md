# Cellular Networks
## What is a cellular network
- Cell refers to the "Cells" that land is divided between antennas
- antennas are usually in a perimeter in a cell and that triangulates location too
## 2G network
- 2G is divided into two different bands (at least in the US)
### GSM
- 90% of the market
- EU standard
- World Wide coverage
- Requires a SIM card
- used multiplexing
	- reserves a bit of time allocation for each user
### CDMA
- Everyone communicated at the same time
- every call used a different code
- codes are used to filter each call on the receiving side
- not well adopted
- handsets controlled by provider
## 3G network
- introduced in 1998
- Several `mb` a second
- bandwidth improvement
- Access to:
	- GPS
	- Mobile TV
	- Video on demand
## 4G network
At this point CDMA lost the war and GSM became the standard. LTE was a method to bridge the gaps
### LTE (Long term evolution)
- became the coverage standard
- based on GSM/EDGE (**E**nhanced **D**ata Rates for **G**SM **R**evolution)
- `150 mb/s` standard support
- uses CDMA and GSM together
### LTE-A(dvanced)
- 300mb/s
## 5G network
- Slower speeds 100-900mb/s
- highest speed 10 gb/s
- higher frequency
### IOT benefits
- bandwidth less of as issue
- longer data transfers
- faster monitoring of items (think 5G RC servos)
- additional cloud Processing
##  PRL Updates
Preferred Roaming List are pushed to cellphones to update tower information
Carrier puts new towers-> Carrier updates list -> Carriers push list to devices in their network -> devices connect to new towers
- updates through OTA
- Comes from CDMA networks
## Hotspots
- Cell data to router (can be your phone or a mobile router)
- Dependent on your provider
# Bluetooth
### Pairing
- Should be automatic
- might use a pin as a method of security
- Remember that discover mode is a thing and it might need to be set manually
- select discovered device
- enter pin and it should connect
# GPS
- made by the U.S. Department of Defense
- Over 30 set in orbit
- Precise navigation needs at least 4 satellites
- location is determined by log, lat and altitude
## GPS on devices
normally viewed on Maps or geo data in photographs
physical location is based on GPS, WiFi, and Cell Towers
# Mobile Device Management
Manage company and/or user owned mobile devices
- BYOD Bring your own device
 Centralized management of the mobile devices
- Set policies on apps, data, camera, etc.
- Control the remote device
- set the entire device or a "partition" for work
- Manage the type of access 
	- Such as force screen locks and and locks on devices
## Corporate Email configurations
with this setup users do not need to configure anything. the MDM configures account details, server address, communication methods
## Two-Factor
Require specific authentication types such as
- Biometrics
- authenticator applications
Corporate applications
- Allow or restrict app installation
- Prevent unath app usage
# Mobile Device Configuration
Many of the settings on your device have a default configuration, although there are other things that have to be done to configure for your use.
## Email
- There are multiple variables when it comes to email and how it's handled
- Corporate email configurations can vary
## Data Sync
- Based on data rates and speed (on your internet service)
- important for backup and recovery
## Microsoft 365
### Outlook and exchange
- usually for hotmail and outlook.com
1. You need to auth with username/password
2. From there you can enable/ disable sync items
	- mail
	- contacts
	- calendars
	- etc.
- Same for Gsuite/ google workplace
## icloud
Integrated into iOS and iPadOS
1. Provide a username and password 
2. Select sync Options
3. Sync to MacOS and other apple devices
### Data Types
- Mail
- Media
- Calendar
- Contacts
## Data Caps
You can control data limits for downloads on cell or metered wifi connections
