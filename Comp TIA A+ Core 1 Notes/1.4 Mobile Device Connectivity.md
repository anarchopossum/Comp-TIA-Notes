# Cellular Networks
## What is a cellular network
- Cell refers to the "Cells" that land is divided between antennas
- antennas are usually in a perimeter in a cell and that triangulates location too
## 2G network
- 2G is divided into two different bands (at least in the US)
### GSM
- 90% of the market
- EU standard
- World Wide coverage
- Requires a SIM card
- used multiplexing
	- reserves a bit of time allocation for each user
### CDMA
- Everyone communicated at the same time
- every call used a different code
- codes are used to filter each call on the receiving side
- not well adopted
- handsets controlled by provider
## 3G network
- introduced in 1998
- Several `mb` a second
- bandwidth improvement
- Access to:
	- GPS
	- Mobile TV
	- Video on demand
## 4G network
At this point CDMA lost the war and GSM became the standard. LTE was a method to bridge the gaps
### LTE (Long term evolution)
- became the coverage standard
- based on GSM/EDGE (**E**nhanced **D**ata Rates for **G**SM **R**evolution)
- `150 mb/s` standard support
- uses CDMA and GSM together
### LTE-A(dvanced)
- 300mb/s
## 5G network
- Slower speeds 100-900mb/s
- highest speed 10 gb/s
- higher frequency
### IOT benefits
- bandwidth less of as issue
- longer data transfers
- faster monitoring of items (think 5G RC servos)
- additional cloud Processing
# PRL Updates
Preferred Roaming List are pushed to cellphones to update tower information
Carrier puts new towers-> Carrier updates list -> Carriers push list to devices in their network -> devices connect to new towers
- updates through OTA
- Comes from CDMA networks
## Hotspots
- Cell data to router (can be your phone or a mobile router)
- Dependent on your provider
