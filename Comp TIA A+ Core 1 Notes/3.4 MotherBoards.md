# Form Factors
Comp TIA Exam will give scenarios for installing, configuring motherboards, CPUs, and add-on cards.
Focus on which MOBO is the best for the Scenario
- Example which MOBO would be best for Media, Video Editing, thin clients, etc.
# Expansion Slots
## PCI
Both PCI busses work as parallel meaning they use the same channels to process information into the motherboards south bridge controller
- Created in 1994
- 32bit and 64bit bus available 
	- 32 bit it smaller in physical size too
- found in older devices
	- PCIe is now used

### 64bit PCI power

## PCIe 
Unidirectional serial "lanes"
- Slower devices don't slow the rest of the system
these lanes are full-duplex and are coined
- x1
- x2
- x4
- x8
- x16
- x32
# MotherBoard Connectors
## MOBO power
- 24-pin
	- +3.3V | +/-5 V | +/-12 V
## CPU Power
4-pin +12V power
# Bios
## UEFI
based on intel EFI
has updated drivers compared to legacy boot
## Entering BIOS
- Hyper V
- VMware workstation player
- alternative bios simulators are online
## Fast Startup
windows feature and how to turn it off

## Bios settings
USB can be a attack point you can disable USB connections from the bios

## Secure boot 
needs proper signature to boot an OS with the public key.

## Bios password
the Supervisor password removes the ability to modify password. boot password will not allow to boot OS. 
## TPM
used for cryptographic functions. usually has a 
- processor and persistent memory
- Versatile memory
## HSM
Hardware Security Module are often used in large environments with cryptographic hardware. sometimes they are usb drives. like a yubikey

# CPU Features
32bit CPUS can access 2^32 values - 4GB
64bit CPUs can access 2^64 values -  17 billion GB

## Multithreading
helps 15% to 30% of improvement

## Virtualization
hardware improvements to virtualization. intel uses VT. AMD uses AMD-V.
