# IAAS
sometimes called hardware as a service (HAAS)
- outsources equipment and buy time on someones hardware.
- you're responsible to manage website/service  and the security for that.
# SAAS
On demand software
- No local installation
	- think of google docs, email.
- Central management of data/apps
	- you don't have to worry about security, the service provider does.
# PAAS
No servers, No software, No maintenance team, No HVAC.
- someone handles the platform, you handle development
You have no direct control of the data, people, or infrastructure.
- trained security professionals are watching your stuff.
You basically have to add the modules off the building blocks.
SalesForce is an example.
