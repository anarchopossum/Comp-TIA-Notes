# Twisted Pair Copper Cabling (Ethernet)
These are balanced pair operation meaning equal & opposite signals
These Pair have a solid color cable and a same color cable with a white stripe. 
These pairs are called in the trade:
- Transmit Pos/Neg
- Receive Pos/Neg
Keep these two cables **Twisted** so that there is less interference going through the line.
- each of these cables have a different twist
- the twist rate gives a different signals
## Copper Cable Standards

- Take note of the Standard name
	- 1000Base = 1Gb/s
	- 10GBase = 10Gb/s
# Coaxial Cables (RG-6)
Used for connecting to Modems and television boxes.
- Has a lot of shielding 
- Share a common axis
# Plenum rated cables
## What is it?
these are cables that are rated to not give off toxic fumes when there is a fire. This is commonly an issue where there are no force air exhaust in a work environment such as an office.
Types of Fire rated cable jackets (the plastic sleeves on ethernet cables)
- FEP - Fluorinated ethylene polymer
- PVC - **Low Smoke** Polyvinyl chloride
==Usually cables are shielded in a PVC jacket but not all are Low Smoke==
## Plenum space
- Building air circulation (generally the ceiling of the building)
- Heating and air conditioning system
- Make sure to use the right cables for the situation

# Shielding
## UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair
- No additional shielding
- Most common type
## STP - Shielded Twisted Pair
- Shielded twisted pair (Braided Shielding)
- The overall cable (Foil Shielding)
- Has a grounding cable which is required to use
- protects against interference

# Abbreviation
Look on the side of the cables
- U = Unshielded
- S = Braided Shielding
- F = Foil Shielding
the format for these is:
(Overall Cable Type) / (individual cables)TP
Examples:
- S/FTP - Braided shielding and individual foil cable shielding
- F/UTP - Foil shielding and No individual cable shielding

# Direct Burial STP
- Overhead cables are not always the best option. sometimes it's best to have them go underground
- Designed to be outside and waterproof they sometimes have gel inside for insulation.
- Provides grounding and added strength
- protects against signal interference
- Drain wire (ground) to remove additional voltage in the cable

# Optical Fiber
- Fiber communication is transmitted via light.
- difficult to be monitored or tapped by RF signal
- Signal slow to degrade - made for long distance
- immune to Radio interference
- better at distance than Copper cables

The Cladding Absorbs the stray light so it doesn't bounce back in the cable

## Multimode Fiber
Short-range communication, up to 2km
- mostly use LEDS
![[Pasted image 20240422230338.png]]
## Single-Mode fiber
Long Range communication, up to 100km
- uses lasers

# 568A and 568B Colors
## Structured Cabling Standards
### International ISO/IEC 11801 cabling standards
- Defines classes of networking standards
### Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) USA
- ANSI/TIA-586: Commercial BuildingTelecommunications Cabling Standard
Commonly referenced for pin and pair assignments of 8 conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted pair cabling
- T568A and T568B
# T568A and T568B termination
T568B
- 8 conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted-pair cabling
T568A and T568B are different pin assignment in 8P8C connectors
- Assigns the T568 pin-out to horizontal cabling
Many Organizations use 568B
- although difficult to change mid stream
Make sure that both are setup the same A with A, B with B
## Color Paterns
