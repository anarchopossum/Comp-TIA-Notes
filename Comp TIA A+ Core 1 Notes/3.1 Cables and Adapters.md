# Twisted Pair Copper Cabling #Ethernet
These are balanced pair operation meaning equal & opposite signals
These Pair have a solid color cable and a same color cable with a white stripe. 
These pairs are called in the trade:
- Transmit Pos/Neg
- Receive Pos/Neg
Keep these two cables **Twisted** so that there is less interference going through the line.
- each of these cables have a different twist
- the twist rate gives a different signals
## Copper Cable Standards
![[Pasted image 20240422220234.png]]
- Take note of the Standard name
	- 1000Base = 1Gb/s
	- 10GBase = 10Gb/s
## Coaxial Cables (RG-6)
Used for connecting to Modems and television boxes.
- Has a lot of shielding 
- Share a common axis
## Plenum rated cables
### What is it?
these are cables that are rated to not give off toxic fumes when there is a fire. This is commonly an issue where there are no force air exhaust in a work environment such as an office.
Types of Fire rated cable jackets (the plastic sleeves on ethernet cables)
- FEP - Fluorinated ethylene polymer
- PVC - **Low Smoke** Polyvinyl chloride
==Usually cables are shielded in a PVC jacket but not all are Low Smoke==
### Plenum space
- Building air circulation (generally the ceiling of the building)
- Heating and air conditioning system
- Make sure to use the right cables for the situation

## Shielding
### UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair
- No additional shielding
- Most common type
### STP - Shielded Twisted Pair
- Shielded twisted pair (Braided Shielding)
- The overall cable (Foil Shielding)
- Has a grounding cable which is required to use
- protects against interference 
![[Pasted image 20240422221841.png]]
## Abbreviation
Look on the side of the cables
- U = Unshielded
- S = Braided Shielding
- F = Foil Shielding
the format for these is:
(Overall Cable Type) / (individual cables)TP
Examples:
- S/FTP - Braided shielding and individual foil cable shielding
- F/UTP - Foil shielding and No individual cable shielding

## Direct Burial STP
- Overhead cables are not always the best option. sometimes it's best to have them go underground
- Designed to be outside and waterproof they sometimes have gel inside for insulation.
- Provides grounding and added strength
- protects against signal interference
- Drain wire (ground) to remove additional voltage in the cable

# #Optical-Fiber
- Fiber communication is transmitted via light.
- difficult to be monitored or tapped by RF signal
- Signal slow to degrade - made for long distance
- immune to Radio interference
- better at distance than Copper cables
![[Pasted image 20240422230054.png]]
The Cladding Absorbs the stray light so it doesn't bounce back in the cable
![[Pasted image 20240422230159.png]]
## Multimode Fiber
Short-range communication, up to 2km
- mostly use LEDS
![[Pasted image 20240422230338.png]]
## Single-Mode fiber
Long Range communication, up to 100km
- uses lasers

# #568A and #568B Colors
## Structured Cabling Standards
### International ISO/IEC 11801 cabling standards
- Defines classes of networking standards
### Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) USA
- ANSI/TIA-586: Commercial BuildingTelecommunications Cabling Standard
Commonly referenced for pin and pair assignments of 8 conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted pair cabling
- T568A and T568B
# T568A and T568B termination
T568B
- 8 conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted-pair cabling
T568A and T568B are different pin assignment in 8P8C connectors
- Assigns the T568 pin-out to horizontal cabling
Many Organizations use 568B
- although difficult to change mid stream
Make sure that both are setup the same A with A, B with B

# #SCSI - Small Computer System Interface
- originally designed to string many peripherals together on a single cable or controller
	- Up to 16 devices in a SCSI "chain"
	- Parallel and Serial Options available 
## Many different formats:
	- Fast SCSI
	- Ultra SCSI
	- Ultra Wide SCSI
	- Ultra2 SCSI
	- Ultra3 SCSI
	- Ultra-320 SCSI
	- Ultra-640 SCSI
	- iSCSI (SCSI over IP)

![[Pasted image 20240424200553.png]]
## Advantages
- useful for several device types
- many devices on a single bus
	- 8 on narrow bus
	- 16 on wide bus
- Standard for Virtual Drives
## SCSI ID and Logical Unit (LUN)
Every SCSI device on a single bus is assigned a separate ID number
- SCSI ID 0 (SCSI controller)
- ID 2 (HDD)
- ID 3 (CD)
- etc.
### Logical Units are defined within each SCSI ID
- Separate drives in storage array
- Virtual machine
### Signals at the End of the line you should have a SCSI terminator
- Can be an internal or external device
### Serial attached SCSI (SAS) devices don't have
- Jumpers
- Terminators
- settings
## Serial attached SCSI
### Move from parallel to serial
- increased throughput
### Point to point connections
- No more Daisy chains
### No terminations required
gives the control and management of a SCSI, but with better throughput

- speed improvements from 16MB/s through 133 MB/s
## PATA cables
- 40 pins
	- first connection in the wire is device 0
- 80 pins
	- Created to minimize cross talk, same amount of pins for device connectors
	- Last connection in the wire is device 1

# #Adapters and Converters
Converting between different connectors are easy when they are electrically compatible. Although when you need to convert from one format to another it can be tricky
## DVI-D to HDMI
HDMI is backwards compatible with DVI-D
- Both are electrically compatible
- No signal conversion
- No video quality loss
## DVI-A to VGA
DVI-A is backwards compatible with VGA
- Only 640x480 is officially supported
## Analog to Digital and ViceVersa
You will need a device that will convert the signals since they are not compatible.
## USB to Ethernet
some laptops don't have Ethernet connection. you will need to connect a USB to Ethernet cable. Sometimes you will need an extra converter to get USB-A to USB C for apple laptops
