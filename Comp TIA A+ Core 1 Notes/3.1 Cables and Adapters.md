# Twisted Pair Copper Cabling (Ethernet)
These are balanced pair operation meaning equal & opposite signals
These Pair have a solid color cable and a same color cable with a white stripe. 
These pairs are called in the trade:
- Transmit Pos/Neg
- Receive Pos/Neg
Keep these two cables **Twisted** so that there is less interference going through the line.
- each of these cables have a different twist
- the twist rate gives a different signals
## Copper Cable Standards

- Take note of the Standard name
	- 1000Base = 1Gb/s
	- 10GBase = 10Gb/s
# Coaxial Cables (RG-6)
Used for connecting to Modems and television boxes.
- Has a lot of shielding 
- Share a common axis
# Plenum rated cables
## What is it?
these are cables that are rated to not give off toxic fumes when there is a fire. This is commonly an issue where there are no force air exhaust in a work environment such as an office.
Types of Fire rated cable jackets (the plastic sleeves on ethernet cables)
- FEP - Fluorinated ethylene polymer
- PVC - **Low Smoke** Polyvinyl chloride
==Usually cables are shielded in a PVC jacket but not all are Low Smoke==
## Plenum space
- Building air circulation (generally the ceiling of the building)
- Heating and air conditioning system
- Make sure to use the right cables for the situation

# Shielding
## UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair
- No additional shielding
- Most common type
## STP - Shielded Twisted Pair
- Shielded twisted pair (Braided Shielding)
- The overall cable (Foil Shielding)
- Has a grounding cable which is required to use
- protects against interference

# Abbreviation
Look on the side of the cables
- U = Unshielded
- S = Braided Shielding
- F = Foil Shielding
the format for these is:
(Overall Cable Type) / (individual cables)TP
Examples:
- S/FTP - Braided shielding and individual foil cable shielding
- F/UTP - Foil shielding and No individual cable shielding

# Direct Burial STP
- Overhead cables are not always the best option. sometimes it's best to have them go underground
- Designed to be outside and waterproof they sometimes have gel inside for insulation.
- Provides grounding and added strength
- protects against signal interference
- Drain wire (ground) to remove additional voltage in the cable
