# IPv4
Used everywhere
OSI Layer 3 address
they use 4 sections of 8 bits (a byte in total)
- 32 bits = 4 bytes
- each byte can be max 255
## Subnet mask
- Used by local devices to determine what subnet it's on
	- Not transmitted through the network normally (DHCP has it covered)
	- You'll ask for the subnet mask every time to assign an IP
## Default Gateway
the routers IP address so it can communicate outside of the subnet/network

# IPv6
Most major OS support IPv6 and is the backbone of our infrastructure
- 128 in length | 16 bits per section | 8 sections
- 320 undecillion
- First 64 bits are generally the prefix (/64)
- last 64 are the host network address

# Assigning IP Addresses
Originally we had to assign everything manually
## BOOTP
- was a start to automating, although was not complete, it still needed some manual input
- Did not have a function to know when a device has left the network
## #DHCP
- 1997, updated through the years
- Provides automatic address / IP conf for all devices
# DHCP Process
4 step process check 2.1 Notes for more information

# #APIPA - Automatic private IP Addressing
==**NO DHCP and only LOCAL NETWORK**==
- Aka a link-local address
- You cannot forward by routers
- Reservation is 169.254.0.0 -> 169.254.255.255
- First and last addresses are reserved
- ==Functional Block is 169.254.1.0 -> 169.254.254.255==
- Random Addressing
	- uses ARP to check addresses not in use
- Subnet Mask of 255.255.0.0
