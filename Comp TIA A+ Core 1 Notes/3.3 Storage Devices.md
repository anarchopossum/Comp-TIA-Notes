# Types of Storage Devices
## HDD
- Magnetic Storage
- Random Access
	- Retrieve data from any part of the drive at any time
### HDD Parts
- Actuator
- Arm
- Platter
- Spindle
### HDD Speeds

## SSD
Non Volatile Memory with no moving parts and thus really fast.
### MSATA
shrinks the drive to be even smaller. this stands for mini sata. even smaller is m.2
### AHCI VS NVMe
#AHCI is used to move drive data to RAM. with SATA 3 the throughput is 600MB/s. SSDs need faster communications
#NVME is designed for SSD Speeds and supports higher throughout

### M.2 Interface
Smaller Form factor
- No SATA data or power cables
- Can use a PCI Express bus connection
	- 4GB/s Throughput or faster on PCIe x4
- Check MOBO for Key and AHCI/NVMe compatibility
#### M.2 Keys
- b key
- m key
- some support both

## Flash Drives
#EEPROM (Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory)
- Not Designed for Archiving
### Types of Flash drives
- CF
- SD
- MicroSD
- miniSD
- XD picturecard
## Optical Drives
Slow media DVD, CD, Blue-Ray

# RAID
==RAID IS NOT BACKUP==
Redundant Array of Independent Disks
## RAID 0
File blocks are split between two or more physical drives.
- High Performance
- No redundancy

# RAID 1
referred as mirroring
- duplicates files between two or more drives. (redundant)
- Requires a lot of disk space

# RAID 5
File Blocks are striped with a Parity block. #parity blocks help to rebuild data when a drive is lost
- you need at least 3 disks
- High redundancy (parity calculation will affect performance)

## RAID 10 (1+0)
A stripe of mirrors combine the benefits of RAID 0 in terms of holding DATA, but instead of having individual sets, of drives we have them mirrored with raid 1
