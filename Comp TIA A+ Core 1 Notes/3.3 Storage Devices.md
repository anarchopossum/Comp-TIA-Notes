# SSD
Non Volatile Memory with no moving parts and thus really fast.
## MSATA
shrinks the drive to be even smaller. this stands for mini sata. even smaller is m.2
## AHCI VS NVMe
#AHCI is used to move drive data to RAM. with SATA 3 the throughput is 600MB/s. SSDs need faster communications
#NVME is designed for SSD Speeds and supports higher throughout

## M.2 Interface
Smaller Form factor
- No SATA data or power cables
- Can use a PCI Express bus connection
	- 4GB/s Throughput or faster on PCIe x4
- Check MOBO for Key and AHCI/NVMe compatibility
### M.2 Keys
- b key
- m key
- some support both

# Flash Drives
#EEPROM (Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory)
- Not Designed for Archiving
## Types of Flash drives
- CF
- SD
- MicroSD
- miniSD
- XD picturecard
# Optical Drives
Slow media DVD, CD, Blue-Ray
