# Intro
These are my Comptia notes, Feel free to use them to study for your exams!
At the moment I only have the A+ exam passed at the moment. I hope to keep updating my notes as I keep advancing in my career.
## A+ Certificate
I used my notes based off Proffesor Messer's [1101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87t6P5ZHTP0&list=PLG49S3nxzAnnOmvg5UGVenB_qQgsh01uC) and [1102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MHDU4kFChU&list=PLG49S3nxzAnna96gzhJrzkii4hH_mgW4b) video series. 

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as my note taking software, although use any other markdown software of your choice.

### My Recomendations
1. Use [Proffesor Messer's practice quizes](https://www.professormesser.com/). Please support his work. His videos help so much!
2. Watch practice exam videos by [BurningIceTech](https://www.youtube.com/@BurningIceTech/featured)
3. Use Make your own [Anki Deck](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).  [What is Anki ???](https://youtube.com/shorts/NsIinCw20O4?si=5mX6UufUcsiipmGF)
4. Modify my notes so that they work for you
5. Find discount vouchers, the harder you look the better the deal!
